To perform actions like rating a movie, adding to a watchlist, or creating a favorite list, you need a session ID.

## Step 1: Create a Request Token

First, request a temporary request token. This token expires after 60 minutes if not used.

Endpoint:

```
POST /authentication/token/new
```

Example Request:

```plaintext
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/token/new?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "expires_at": "2025-02-12 10:30:00 UTC",
  "request_token": "123456abcdef"
}
```

## Step 2: Ask the User for Permission

Redirect the user to the following URL to approve your request token:

```plaintext
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}
```

If you want to redirect the user back to your app after approval, append redirect_to:

```plaintext
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}?redirect_to=http://www.yourapp.com/approved
```

Once approved, the request token is now authorized for the next step.

### Step 3: Create a Session ID

After the user approves the request token, you must exchange it for a session ID.

Endpoint:

```
POST /authentication/session/new
```

Example Request:

```plaintext
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/session/new?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "request_token": "123456abcdef"
}
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session_id": "789xyz"
}
```
