You can authenticate TMDB users within your application to extend the TMDB experience within your application. This will let your users (nay—our users) do things like rate movies, maintain their favourite and watch lists as well as do things like create and edit custom lists—all while staying in sync with their account on TMDB.

User authentication is controlled with a session_id query parameter. You can generate a session_id by following the steps outlined below:

## Step 1: Create a Request Token

First, request a temporary request token. This token expires after 60 minutes if not used.

Endpoint:

```
POST /authentication/token/new
```

Example Request:

```plaintext
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/token/new?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "expires_at": "2025-02-12 10:30:00 UTC",
  "request_token": "123456abcdef"
}
```

## Step 2: Ask the User for Permission

Redirect the user to the following URL to approve your request token:

```plaintext
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}
```

If you want to redirect the user back to your app after approval, append redirect_to:

```plaintext
https://www.themoviedb.org/authenticate/{REQUEST_TOKEN}?redirect_to=http://www.yourapp.com/approved
```

Once approved, the request token is now authorized for the next step.

### Step 3: Create a Session ID

After the user approves the request token, you must exchange it for a session ID.

Endpoint:

```
POST /authentication/session/new
```

Example Request:

```plaintext
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/session/new?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Request Body:

```json
{
  "request_token": "123456abcdef"
}
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "session_id": "789xyz"
}
```
