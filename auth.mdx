## API Key Authentication (For Basic Requests)

Application level authentication would generally be considered the default way of authenticating yourself on the API. Version 3 is controlled by one of either a single query parameter, api_key, or by using your access token as a Bearer token.

You can request an API key by logging in to your account on TMDB.

### Bearer Token

The default method to authenticate is with your access token. If you head into your account page, under the API settings section, you will see a new token listed called **_API Read Access Token_**. This token is expected to be sent along as an Authorization header as seen below. A simple cURL example using this method looks like the following:

```cURL

curl --request GET \
     --url 'https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/11' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

Using the Bearer token has the added benefit of being a single authentication process that you can use across both the v3 and v4 methods.
