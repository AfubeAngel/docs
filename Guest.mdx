# Guest Sessions (For Rating Without an Account)

Guest sessions are a second type of user authentication. They have limited permissions as they can only rate a movie, TV show and TV episode. Creating a guest session is as simple as calling the new guest session method.

Just like a fully authorized user session, guest sessions should be kept private as they tie a session within your application to a single token.

Endpoint:

```
GET /authentication/guest_session/new
```

Example Request:

```plaintext
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/authentication/guest_session/new?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example Response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "guest_session_id": "abcd1234",
  "expires_at": "2025-02-12 12:00:00 UTC"
}
```

## Conclusion

TMDB provides API Key authentication for general data access and Session-based authentication for user-specific actions. Use the appropriate method based on your needs.
