### What is TMDB's API?

The API service is for those of you interested in using our movie, TV show, or actor images and/or data in your application. Our API is a system we provide for you and your team to programmatically fetch and use our data and/or images.

### How do I apply for an API key?

You can apply for an API key by clicking the **"API"** link from the left-hand sidebar within your account settings page.

### Is there an SLA?

We do not currently provide an SLA. However, we do make every reasonable attempt to keep our service online and accessible. You can view our **[status page](https://status.themoviedb.org/)** here.

### Are there any API wrappers or libraries I can use?

There sure is! **[Check them out here](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/wrappers-and-libraries).**

### What about SSL?

It's currently available **API-wide**. This includes both the API endpoints and assets served via our CDN. We strongly recommend you use SSL.

### Is there a commercial service?

Yes. You can contact our sales team by emailing **[sales@themoviedb.org](mailto:sales@themoviedb.org)**. Please include the country you're from to help us expedite your request.

### What is the difference between a commercial API and a developer API?

A **commercial API** is for commercial projects, while a **developer API** is for developers. Your project is considered commercial if the primary purpose is to create revenue for the benefit of the owner.

### Does the API key cost anything?

Our API is **free to use for non-commercial purposes** as long as you **attribute TMDB** as the source of the data and/or images.  
If you are interested in obtaining a **commercial license**, please contact **[sales@themoviedb.org](mailto:sales@themoviedb.org)** and include your country to help expedite your request.

### Does the API ever change? How can I learn about new features?

Yes, the API can change from time to time. We try our best to post relevant updates in the **[official documentation](#)**. You can also keep tabs on our **changelog**.

### What are the attribution requirements?

You **must use** the TMDB logo to identify your use of the TMDB APIs.  
You must prominently display the following notice in your application:

> "This product uses the TMDB API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDB."

The TMDB logo in your application **must be less prominent** than your own branding. Attribution must be placed in the **"About"** or **"Credits"** section of your app.

### Can I make changes to the API?

No, you **cannot**. TMDBâ€™s API is **closed source**.

### Are there branding requirements?

- The TMDB **logo should not be modified** in color, aspect ratio, flipped, or rotated.
- The logo can be **white, black, or any approved colors** used in TMDB branding.
- For a list of **official logos**, visit our **[logos & attribution page](https://www.themoviedb.org/about/logos-attribution)**.

When referring to TMDB, use **"TMDB"** or **"The Movie Database"**â€”no other variations.
